# Architecture Rules

## Layering
- Core logic MUST NOT import SpriteKit, SwiftUI, or UIKit
- UI layers MUST NOT implement game rules or economy math

## Core Responsibilities
Core owns:
- GameState (saveable state)
- Simulator (tick, buy, prestige)
- Economy math (cost curves, production, caps)
- Catalog data (producers, upgrades, cards, research)

UI owns:
- Rendering
- Input handling
- Debug controls
- Presentation-only state

## Mutation Rules
- GameState may ONLY be mutated by Simulator
- UI reads state but never writes directly

## Time
- Simulator.tick(dt:) is the ONLY place time advances
