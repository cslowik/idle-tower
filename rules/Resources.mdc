# Resources.mdc

## Purpose
This file defines all core resources in the game, including:
- what each resource represents
- how it is earned
- what it is spent on
- whether it is purchasable
- high-level design constraints to prevent resource bloat or misuse

Resources are intentionally limited in count and role. Any new resource must justify why an existing one cannot be reused.

---

## Resource Philosophy
- Each resource must have a **distinct fantasy and mechanical role**
- Resources should not overlap in purpose
- Scarcity and abundance are intentional levers
- Purchasable resources are **accelerators**, never hard requirements
- Prestige is sacred and never purchasable

---

## 🧱 Materials (Mats)

### Fantasy
Physical inputs: alloys, components, substrates, precision parts.

### How Materials Are Earned
- Passive generation from Materials Band floors
- Recycling / salvage systems
- Some cards may temporarily convert other outputs into Materials

### How Materials Are Spent
- Constructing floors
- Feeding fabrication and assembly
- Basic ship construction costs

### Purchase Rules
- ✅ **Purchasable in the store**
- Considered a convenience / acceleration resource
- Should never unlock content on its own

### Design Constraints
- High-volume, low-friction
- Never scarce for long periods
- Should not be used for research or meta-progression
- Losing Materials is never a punishment event

---

## ⚡ Energy

### Fantasy
Power, throughput, and operational capacity of the factory.

### How Energy Is Earned
- Produced by dedicated Energy floors (reactors, generators, etc.)
- Modified by cards, research, and layout efficiency

### How Energy Is Spent
- Running floors
- Fabrication throughput
- Data generation
- Parallel ship construction

Energy is a **soft cap**, not a consumable currency.

### Purchase Rules
- ❌ **Not purchasable**
- Must be earned through structure and decisions

### Design Constraints
- Energy should limit *how much* can run, not *what* can exist
- Energy shortages should pause or throttle systems, not destroy progress
- Energy should be readable and predictable (no surprise drains)

---

## 🧠 Data

### Fantasy
Knowledge, simulations, telemetry, design intelligence.

### How Data Is Earned
Primary sources:
- Optimization / design floors (continuous)
- Ship completion and ship launch analysis (bursts)
- Certain cards that convert activity into Data

Secondary sources:
- Events, rewards, or bundles
- Optional store purchases (accelerators only)

### How Data Is Spent
- Research (general and specialized)
- Unlocking blueprints
- Advanced cards or card upgrades

### Purchase Rules
- ✅ **Purchasable in the store**
- Should feel valuable but never mandatory
- Purchases should smooth waits, not bypass systems

### Design Constraints
- Data is **not** a baseline passive resource
- Data should always feel scarcer than Materials
- Data should not be required for basic construction
- Hoarding Data without research should feel suboptimal

---

## 🏆 Prestige

### Fantasy
Proven value of completed and launched ships.

### How Prestige Is Earned
- **Only** by launching ships
- Never generated passively
- Never generated by floors directly

### How Prestige Is Spent
- Unlocking major systems (e.g., Research)
- Unlocking new ship classes
- Unlocking new card pools or archetypes
- Permanent meta-progression

### Purchase Rules
- ❌ **Never purchasable**
- ❌ Never convertible from other resources

### Design Constraints
- Prestige is rare and deliberate
- Prestige resets the run, not the player's identity
- Prestige should unlock **capabilities**, not just multipliers
- If something feels "prestige-worthy," it should not be buyable

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Resources (Anti-Patterns)

The following are intentionally avoided unless strongly justified:
- Global stability / decay meters
- Offline punishment resources
- "Tax" resources that only block progress
- Duplicate currencies that serve the same role as existing ones

Risk and tension should come from **player choices**, not passive drains.

## Resource Interaction Summary

| Resource | Volume | Earned By | Purchasable | Primary Role |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Materials | High | Passive production | Yes | Build & fabricate |
| Energy | Capacity | Structural decisions | No | Throughput limiter |
| Data | Low | Analysis & launches | Yes | Research & intelligence |
| Prestige | Very low | Ship launches | No | Meta progression |

## Validation Checklist (For New Features)
Before introducing a new mechanic, confirm:
1. Which resource does it use or produce?
2. Does it respect that resource's fantasy?
3. Does it avoid overlapping another resource's role?
4. Does it preserve prestige as non-purchasable?

If any answer is unclear, revisit the design.
